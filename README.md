# Immersive Skill Checks

Extension for Fantasy Grounds that automatically rolls some skill checks for all PCs and tracked NPCs.

These rolls are considered 'immersive' in the sense players should be unaware what their D20 result was, and whether any given failure was due to lack of skill or just bad luck with the dice.
